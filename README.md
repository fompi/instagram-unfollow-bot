# instagram-unfollow-bot
Unfollows all users apart from those specified in a whitelist.

### Instructions

- Install Python 3 (**add to PATH**)
- Install requirements ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Edit the top of run.py with your details
- Run it ```python run.py```


### Info

Test mode will only run once, grab 10 users then stop not unfollowing anyone. I suggest running it with ```test_mode = 1``` for the first run just to make sure everything is working correctly.
